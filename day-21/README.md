# Old School Compass Navigation
Coming from a logistics background I thought I was going to enjoy this one more. However, I think I’d rather play with some maps and draw a line here and there. At the same time, Wes pushed up outside our comfort zones again using the XCode Simulator and reading the console logs from Safira to troubleshoot our phones on our computers… yeah, pretty strange.

The most frustrating part of this was learning that sometimes you just need to keep toggling the simulator to see get the data to stream through. Seems like there’s a bug from what I dug up on StackOverflow.
