    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 29;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    
    // age = 30
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Robert'
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // name = 'Rob';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Rob';
    // Players is actually just a reference to team, which is not the same as nums, strs and bools
    console.log(team)
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    team = players.slice();
    team[3] = 'Rob';
    console.log(team);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team[2] = 'Lexie';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        'twitter': '@robcrock',
        'linkedin': 'robertcrocker'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // You can't simply make a copy as you might think like this
    // const captain = person;
    // This will overwrite the number property of person
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const cap2 = Object.assign( {}, person, {number: 100});
    // console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //Here's a poor mans attempt to do this.
    const dev = Object.assign({}, person);
    // Frist turn it into a string and then immediately turn the string into an object
    dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@wesbos';
