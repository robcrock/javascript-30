# Sticky Nav
I’ve always wondered how the sticky nav worked. In this lesson, Wes breaks it down and sheds some light out how we can make sure we’re offsetting all the elements to avoid jank during when the nav pops from position relative to fixed. Honestly, I probably would've have missed that detail if I was going it alone.

He also makes the point to set the class being added at a certain scrollY on the body or outer most element rather than on the nav itself.
