# Mouse Shadow
Another fun day opening my eyes wider to the various possibilities of controlling attributes and elements on our screens with JavaScript. The big lesson today had to do with event targets.

There is a difference between the element your event listener is tied to and the target that triggered the event. What I “think” I mean by this is that we can have we can have an event listener that is listening to events, but that doesn’t mean they are the target of the event. I imagine this is often the case with nested elements like we had in this lesson.
