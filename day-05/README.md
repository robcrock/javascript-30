#Flex Panel Image Gallery
Pretty much just followed along with Wes today as I havenâ€™t studied CSS all that much. Looks like he has another great course on [Flexbox](flexbox.io) that might be worth a peek after wrapping up this one. That said I still learned a lot about conditional transitions and a nice way to style the functions used in my event handlers.

When you look at the code we wrote is it quite clean. So, even after stepping away from it for sometime it's still approachable.
