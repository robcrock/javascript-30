# JavaScript 30
I have been eying this free course from Wes Bos for sometime now and what better way to kick off the year than with this 30 day practice. Everyday for 30 days I'll be working through fun examples from Wes to explore ways of working with JavaScript I might have missed out on otherwise.

Everyday I'll share interesting things I have learned from the course so you learn more about what's to expect. At the time of writting this I have only finished day 1 and I have already head fun learning new ways JavaScript can be leveraged.
