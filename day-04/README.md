# Array Cardio ðŸ’ª
Enjoyed the array exercises as much as I thought I would. I learned smarter ways of selecting elements from the DOM. And I did attempt to do this on my own before watching Wes go through them. Yes, this is a good idea is you are game to be humbled. The approaches Wes took were much more elegant than the attempts I tried. Specificaly, rather than trying to traverse the DOM in one go I thought a nice apprach was to select the parent element, store that in a variable, which makes accessing the children a little more clear. I also liked how the Reduce function was used. This function isnâ€™t nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
