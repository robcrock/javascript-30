Text to voice was a lot of fun. I also like how we used several different controls on the screen in a very functional way for the users.

I feel like this was a good example of a simple SPA. It was also liked using the blind method to pass an argument into a function being used in an event lisnter so it the function wouldn't fire on page load.
