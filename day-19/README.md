# JS Photo Boothe
The creativity of today’s lesson gave me plenty of fuel for a new project I’m excited to start next month. But besides the additional inspiration, this lesson shed some light on the way pixels are drawn onto the screen. Of course, it was also fun to learn about the webcam API that I’ve never worked with as well!.
