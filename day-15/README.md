# Local Storage
Not sure if sleep is to blame, but I have been creating some seriously problematic typos lately. It’s amazing how much time can be lost to an improperly cased letter. I’m practicing not being frustrated about these inevitable foibles that will happen and powering through, but it’s important to note I should code with more care. The localStorage lesson was thought-provoking. I have heard of the concept before, but haven’t experimented with it extensively. I’d like to work/practice learning more about it. However, it might be more fun to hook up an actual back end database like we did in the React course.
